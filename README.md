## Requirements
Initiation of a *webmorph* project requires:
* web hosting through a server that supports PHP
* a Google Drive account

As the files required to run *webmorph* are small, storage requirements on the hosting server are generally dependent on the file size of the images to be analyzed.

Users must have internet access to submit data.
